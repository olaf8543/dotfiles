                    #\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#

#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\//////////////////////////////////////////////////#

# This section defines how your windows look and behave on the screen. It covers window
# layouts, spacing, borders, animations, and more, allowing you to customize your desktop
# experience for both appearance and functionality.

#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\//////////////////////////////////////////////////#\

#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
###     GENERAL SETTINGS       ###
#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
#Window manager behavior, such as layout, gaps, and tearing prevention. See https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Variables/#general
general {
    gaps_in = 3
    gaps_out = 9

    border_size = 2

    # https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Variables/#variable-types for info about colors
    col.active_border = rgba($gradone) rgba($gradtwo) 45deg
    col.inactive_border = rgba(595959aa)

    # Set to true enable resizing windows by clicking and dragging on borders and gaps
    resize_on_border = false

    # Please see https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Tearing/ before you turn this on
    allow_tearing = false

    layout = master
}

#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
###      MASTER LAYOUT         ###
#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
#Configures the master layout behavior, which divides windows into master and slave areas.
# See https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Master-Layout/ for more

master {
    new_status = slave
}

#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
###     DWINDLE LAYOUT         ###
#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
# Configures the dwindle layout, which is a spiraling tiling pattern for windows. See https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Dwindle-Layout/

dwindle {
    pseudotile = true # Master switch for pseudotiling. Enabling is bound to mainMod + P in the keybinds section below
    preserve_split = true # You probably want this
}


#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
###        WORKSPACES          ###
#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
# Workspace-specific appearance settings


# Customization Tips:
# - You can apply settings like rounding, decoration, or gaps to individual workspaces.
#   Example: workspace = 1, monitor:DP-2, rounding:true, gapsin:5, gapsout:15
#   This would give workspace 1 on DP-2 a rounded appearance with inner and outer window gaps.

# See the following resources for more info:
# - https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Workspace-Rules/
