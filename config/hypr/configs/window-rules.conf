# NOOB-NOTE: Window Rules in Hyprland
# Window rules help you control how windows behave in Hyprland, including what workspace they open on,
# how they appear, and what special behaviors they have. For example, you can force certain apps to always
# open on a specific workspace, make them float, or change their opacity.

# See the following resources for more info:
# - https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Window-Rules/

###         DEV FIXES          ### // These were default fixes included by Developer, I'd leave alone unless you have knowledge and reason for changing. It's probably useful. Probably.
#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
# Ignore maximize requests from apps. You'll probably like this.
windowrulev2 = suppressevent maximize, class:.*
# Fix some dragging issues with XWayland

###         WORKSPACES         ### // This section defines software workspace rules, ensuring they open on your desired workspaces. Useful for organizing apps by class/purpose
#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#

# Ref https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Workspace-Rules/
# "Smart gaps" / "No gaps when only"
# uncomment all if you wish to use that.
# workspace = w[tv1], gapsout:0, gapsin:0
# workspace = f[1], gapsout:0, gapsin:0
# windowrulev2 = bordersize 0, floating:0, onworkspace:w[tv1]
# windowrulev2 = rounding 0, floating:0, onworkspace:w[tv1]
# windowrulev2 = bordersize 0, floating:0, onworkspace:f[1]
# windowrulev2 = rounding 0, floating:0, onworkspace:f[1]


#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
###         OPACITY            ### // This section forces window opacity per application.
#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#

windowrulev2 = opacity 0.90 override,class:^(zen)$, fullscreen:0

windowrulev2 = opacity 0.80 override, class:^(xdg-desktop-portal-gtk)$


#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
####         FLOAT             ### // This gives windows a traditional "floating" functionality akin to that of Windows/KDE Plasma. SUPER+V to see example
#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
# windowrule = float, ^(nwg-look)$

windowrulev2 = float, class:^(pix)$  # this is when you open a png
# windowrule = float, ^(Spotify)$
# windowrule = float, ^(waypaper)$
#windowrule = float, ^(Vivaldi-Stable)$

#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
###        FULLSCREEN          ### // Forces applications into fullscreen by default.
#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
#If you're having issues with steam games not adopting your monitors resolution on launch, try forcing to fullscreen. Launch game and run 'hyprctl clients' to get the games class: and title: then force here. Might work(?)

# RESTRICTIONS / OMMITIONS     ###
#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#

#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
###       NO ANIMATION         ### // This force-disables animation effects (such as fading or sliding) per window.
#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
# windowrulev2 = noanim, class:^(xwaylandvideobridge)$



#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
###      NO INITIAL FOCUS      ### // This prevents this window from automatically receiving focus when it opens
#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
# windowrulev2 = noinitialfocus, class:^(xwaylandvideobridge)$



#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
###      WINDOW SIZE           ###
#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
windowrulev2 = size 60% 70%, class:^(xdg-desktop-portal-gtk)$ 
windowrulev2 = size 60% 70%, class:^(thunar)$ 
windowrulev2 = size 75% 75%, class:^(pix)$ 
windowrulev2 = size 600 800, class:^(clipse-gui.py)$ 

#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
###          Testing           ### // I use this section for testing configurations I'm unsure of functionality or purpose
#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/////////////////#
# Add to ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf
