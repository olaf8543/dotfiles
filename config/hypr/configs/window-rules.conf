                    ###        WINDOW RULES        ###

# NOOB-NOTE: Window Rules in Hyprland
# Window rules help you control how windows behave in Hyprland, including what workspace they open on,
# how they appear, and what special behaviors they have. For example, you can force certain apps to always
# open on a specific workspace, make them float, or change their opacity.

# Common Use Cases:
#  - **Workspace Rules**: Force apps to open on specific workspaces (e.g., open Spotify on workspace 6)
#    Example: windowrulev2 = workspace 6, class:Spotify title:Spotify Premium
#
#  - **Floating Windows**: Make certain windows "float" (not tiled) by default, like Steam or Discord.
#    Example: windowrule = float, ^(Spotify)$
#
#  - **Fullscreen**: Automatically make certain apps fullscreen when they open.
#    Example: windowrulev2 = fullscreen, class:^steam_app_2694490$
#
#  - **Opacity**: Control window opacity for specific applications, making them more transparent.
#    Example: windowrulev2 = opacity 0.85 override, class:Spotify

# Important Notes:
# - **Max/Min Window Size**: Set limits on window sizes (e.g., hiding windows by making them very small).
#   Example: windowrulev2 = maxsize 1 1, class:^(xwaylandvideobridge)$
#
# - **No Initial Focus**: Prevent certain apps from gaining focus automatically when they open.
#   Example: windowrulev2 = noinitialfocus, class:^(xwaylandvideobridge)$
#
# - **No Animation**: Disable window animations for specific apps.
#   Example: windowrulev2 = noanim, class:^(xwaylandvideobridge)$
#
# - **Blur**: Turn off window blur effects for specific apps.
#   Example: windowrulev2 = noblur, class:^(xwaylandvideobridge)$

###        FULLSCREEN          ### // Forces applications into fullscreen by default.

#If you're having issues with steam games not adopting your monitors resolution on launch, try forcing to fullscreen. Launch game and run 'hyprctl clients' to get the games class: and title: then force here. Might work(?)
