Just switched to arch and this is nuts
ill leave other instructions below but on arch this is all you do 
this would also work for any distro that had lolcat available in their 
package manager repository

1:  Install lolcat
        sudo pacman -S lolcat

2:  go to gem which lolcat and instead of lolcat.rb, go to lib/lol.rb 
    and look for the self rainbow function and edit it like this

    replace the standard self rainbow function with this

  def self.rainbow(freq, i)
    # Define your start and end colors in RGB
    start_color = [0xFD, 0xF0, 0x87]
    end_color   = [0xFA, 0x69, 0x4E]

    # Calculate interpolation factor (0.0 to 1.0)
    t = (Math.sin(freq * i) + 1) / 2.0  # Maps to 0-1 range

    # Linear interpolation for each RGB component
    r = (start_color[0] + (end_color[0] - start_color[0]) * t).round
    g = (start_color[1] + (end_color[1] - start_color[1]) * t).round
    b = (start_color[2] + (end_color[2] - start_color[2]) * t).round

    "#%02X%02X%02X" % [r, g, b]
  end

3: edit the ./lib/lolcat/lol.rb file in the self rainbow function like this.
        find these two lines

            start_color = [0x00, 0xFF, 0x82]    # 00ff82
            end_color   = [0x00, 0xFF, 0xB3]    # 00ffb3

        change the color in the brackets to match whatever two colors you want.
        Each element in the array is a color channel, so [0x00, 0xFF, 0x82] is
        00FF82, becasue 0x(00), 0x(FF), 0x(82). Take each value after the 0x
        gives you 00FF82. 

it should work completely now

You might notice that nothing is in here but lolcat is used in my shell config and 
it should be something that you want to install onto the system because it looks so
sick. I instead decided to opt instead give instructions on how to do this so it is 
as easy as possible.

1:  Make sure you have ruby installed. I am not actually sure if you need it,
    but i installed it because i thought i would need it, but after figuring
    out i honestly would bet that it is unnecessary. I doubt its harmful though
    so i felt like it would be worth it to mention that ruby might need to be
    installed.

    eg. sudo pacman -S ruby
        sudo zypper in ruby
        sudo apt install ruby
        whatever

2:  Clone the official repo somewhere on your system and edit the ./lib/lolcat/lol.rb 
    file in the self rainbow function like this.
        git clone https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat

        replace the standard self rainbow function with this

  def self.rainbow(freq, i)
    # Define your start and end colors in RGB
    start_color = [0xFD, 0xF0, 0x87]
    end_color   = [0xFA, 0x69, 0x4E]

    # Calculate interpolation factor (0.0 to 1.0)
    t = (Math.sin(freq * i) + 1) / 2.0  # Maps to 0-1 range

    # Linear interpolation for each RGB component
    r = (start_color[0] + (end_color[0] - start_color[0]) * t).round
    g = (start_color[1] + (end_color[1] - start_color[1]) * t).round
    b = (start_color[2] + (end_color[2] - start_color[2]) * t).round

    "#%02X%02X%02X" % [r, g, b]
  end

3: edit the ./lib/lolcat/lol.rb file in the self rainbow function like this.
        find these two lines

            start_color = [0x00, 0xFF, 0x82]    # 00ff82
            end_color   = [0x00, 0xFF, 0xB3]    # 00ffb3

        change the color in the brackets to match whatever two colors you want.
        Each element in the array is a color channel, so [0x00, 0xFF, 0x82] is
        00FF82, becasue 0x(00), 0x(FF), 0x(82). Take each value after the 0x
        gives you 00FF82. 

Either add it to your path in your shell

        export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/path/to/lolcat/bin"

this should work and you should have a custom lolcat
