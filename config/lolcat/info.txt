This folder is not linked in the install yaml (rightfully so, as it is not a thing that 
can be configured at all, and in general there is no directory in the .config file)
However, I did edit lolcats functionality and built it into the system. To do that 
yourself, simply follow these steps: 

1:  Make sure you have ruby installed 
    eg. sudo pacman -S ruby
        sudo zypper in ruby
        sudo apt install ruby
        whatever

2: edit the ./lib/lolcat/lol.rb file in the self rainbow function like this.
        find these two lines

            start_color = [0x00, 0xFF, 0x82]    # 00ff82
            end_color   = [0x00, 0xFF, 0xB3]    # 00ffb3

        change the color in the brackets to match whatever two colors you want
        each element in the array is a color channel, so [0x00, 0xFF, 0x82] is
        00FF82, becasue 0x(00), 0x(FF), 0x(82). Take each value after the 0x
        givers you 00FF82. 

2:  cd into this directory (lolcat) and build it with
        gem build lolcat.gemspec
        gem install --local ./lolcat-*.gem

Either add it to your path in your shell or move the bin into your bin directory.

        export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/path/to/lolcat/bin"
        or
        sudo mv ./bin/lolcat /usr/local/bin/lolcat
