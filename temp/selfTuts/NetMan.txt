If you ever have the network manager problem, you can do this to fix it

It is most likely true that network manager correctly resolved into 

    /run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf

And booting into recovery mode unlinked that from the /etc/resolv.conf
so in order to fix this, you can just link it again:

    # Remove the old resolv.conf
    sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
    sudo ln -s /run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
