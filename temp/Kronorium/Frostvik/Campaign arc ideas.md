# **The Niflheim Plague**
- **Problem**: Villagers begin sleepwalking into the sea, lured by a **draugr queen** in Hel’s domain. The party must sail to Niflheim, slay her, and recover stolen souls.
    
- **Impact**: Success stops the drownings and grants the village a “deathless” blessing (resistance to disease). Failure means Hel claims more villagers each week.

# **The Jötunheim Betrayal**
- **Problem**: Frost giants attack the village, demanding payment for Jarl Rurik’s broken pact. To avoid war, the party must travel to Jötunheim and steal back the **Ice Heart** (a village artifact the Jarl gave as collateral).
    
- **Impact**: Retrieving the Heart melts the fjord’s ice, opening trade routes. Losing it dooms Hrafnvik to endless winter.
