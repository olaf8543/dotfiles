### **Setting Overview**  
The campaign takes place in **Skjaldbreidr**, a rugged, snow-draped peninsula inspired by Norse mythology. The region is dotted with isolated villages, ancient barrows, and mist-shrouded forests where spirits and jotun (giants) lurk. The gods watch closely, granting favor to those who prove worthy in battle and cunning.

### **Village Relationships**  
- Frostvik is isolated due to Hrodmar‚Äôs cruelty. Stormholt raids Frostvik‚Äôs hunters, blaming them for poaching.  
- Druid Valthorn refuses to aid Frostvik while Hrodmar rules, but may help rebels who cleanse the Veidrwood.  
- Jarl Egil covertly supplies Hrodmar with mead in exchange for furs, but plans to annex Frostvik.

### **First Session: ‚ÄúBlood on the Snow‚Äù**  
**Hook:** The PCs begin as strangers arriving in Frostvik during the **Winter Sacrifice**, a festival where Hrodmar demands tribute.  

**Opening Scene:**  
- A group of Hrodmar‚Äôs **huskarls** (warrior guards) accuses Astrid Grimsdottir of withholding fish. They drag her into the square to execute her as a ‚Äúlesson.‚Äù  
- **The PCs are in the crowd** (each has a reason to be there: seeking work, trading, fleeing past troubles).  

**Combat Encounter:**  
- As tensions rise, a **winter wolf** (reskinned as a demonic hound summoned by Sigyn) bursts into the square, snarling and freezing villagers with its breath. Hrodmar‚Äôs huskarls panic and flee.  
- The PCs must band together to protect the villagers and drive off the wolf.  

**Key Moments:**  
- Bjarni tosses the PCs weapons from his cart (or blesses them with a **+1 rune** if they‚Äôre martial).  
- Sigyn watches from a rooftop, smirking. If confronted, she vanishes in a swirl of mist.  
- After the fight, Astrid thanks the PCs and whispers, ‚ÄúMeet me at the docks tonight. Hrodmar must fall.‚Äù  

---

### **Post-Combat Roleplay**  
- **Thorgrim the Bent** offers info on Hrodmar‚Äôs hidden armory‚Ä¶ for a barrel of ale.  
- Villagers mutter about a **‚ÄúThunder Stone‚Äù** in Fenrir‚Äôs Maw‚Äîa relic that can summon Thor‚Äôs favor.  
- Bjarni urges the PCs to sabotage Hrodmar‚Äôs tribute cart heading to Jarl Egil, cutting off his support.  

---

### **Plot Threads to Develop**  
- Sigyn‚Äôs cult seeks to free Loki by corrupting Frostvik‚Äôs sacred **Standing Stones**.  
- The spirit of Yggdrasil in Veidrwood is dying; restoring it grants divine aid.  
- Hrodmar‚Äôs axe, **Bloodhowl**, is cursed‚Äîwielding it risks attracting the attention of Hel.  

---

### **Future Sessions**  
- **Levels 2‚Äì3:** Sabotage Hrodmar‚Äôs alliances, recruit Stormholt‚Äôs aid, and slay his **berserker champion** in a holmgang (duel).  
- **Levels 4‚Äì5:** Storm Hrodmar‚Äôs hall during the **Rite of Ascension**, fighting his elite huskarls and Sigyn‚Äôs illusions.  
- **Post-Victory:** Players design Frostvik‚Äôs upgrades (shipyard, palisade, temple) and face threats like jotun raids or a draugar (undead) invasion from barrows.
