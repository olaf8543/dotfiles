# Campaign Pitch
Ok so i just realized that I haven't given you guys any pitch for the campaign to give you guys any direction when making your characters, so here's the basics of what I've wrote so far, any more questions that you have I can answer (unless it will spoil something).

### **Setting Overview**  
The campaign takes place in **Skjaldbreidr** (Scal-bre-deer), a rugged, snow-draped peninsula that i have heavily taken inspiration from Nordic Denmark in its creation. It is one of the many isles of this region, and is littered with isolated villages, ancient barrows, and lots of forests. Of these villages, your characters will start in one called Ulfgard. The region in its entirety is named **Hordalmark**, which roughly translates to "Land of the Warrior-Factions". However, we will not explore the entirety of Hordalmark for a very long time, but think of Skjaldbreidr as iceland/greenland and Hordalmark as Norway. Just know that Hordalmark has lots of hidden divine interventions, gods will often meddle in human affairs. However most are unaware of this, as they often intervene with the "powerful", who mostly keep quiet about it.

> Fun fact, in researching for this, turns out "mark" means either "borderland", "march", or "forest." Denmark's name translates to "The Danish March." 
> 
> In making the name of Hordalmark, I'm using the mark more in the context of the borderland, where in Old Norse, it often describes a wild, contested frontier between settled lands and untamed wilderness (or rival kingdoms).

#### Ulfgard
Ulfgard is honestly a very poorly run village. It doesn't look *that* bad when viewed from the outside, but this place is ran by a dastardly ruler who oppresses those beneath him. His name is **Jarl Hrodmar** (Half-orc he/him) and hes a bitch. Also jarl means "chieftan"-- it is not his name. He vary commonly hoards resources, demands excessive tributes, and punishes dissent with bloodshed. Another character of note is Hrodmar’s advisor, **Sigyn** (Human? she/her). Hrodmar is a very strong looking red haired main wielding a greataxe at almost all times, while Sigyn is clearly a magic user of some sort, but she has rarely been seen doing so. She is dressed very goth (all black fit,  hood up, makeup, the works), and has a long, big, golden pendant she is never seen without. 

Here are some neighboring regions that one would most likely know because you live here:
1. **Stormholt** (2 days north): A rival village led by **Shieldmaiden Ragna Frosthelm** (she/her human), who despises Hrodmar but distrusts outsiders.  
2. **Veidrwood** (1 day east): A sacred grove guarded by **Druid Valthorn** (they/them elf), who communes with the spirit of Yggdrasil. The grove is plagued by blight.  
3. **Fenrir’s Maw** (3 days west): A cursed canyon where wolves howl with human voices. Rumored to hold a shrine to Tyr.  
4. **Egil’s Hall** (5 days south): A wealthy coastal settlement ruled by a greedy jarl trading with Saxon raiders. 


Last thing before I end this off. The session is going to start during the **Winter Sacrifice**, a festival where Hrodmar demands sacrifice. I havent written anything more (that i can tell you) regarding this session, as I want to know more about ur characters before proceeding. Hope this gives you some ideas.
