Symlink or a "Symbolic Link" Is a file whose exact purpose is to point to that of another file.

This is useful for when a program needs a config file and a CSS file to run, but doesn't have a useful way to change between styles and configs easily. Using a symlink, you can simply type.

`ln -sf <path to file> <path to a symlink or file that you want to make a symlink)>`
