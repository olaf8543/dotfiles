1)  I would assume that wisdom is found in the philosopher king, however that is
    discussed later in The Republic, not in Book IV. If that is not the case, then
    I would think that it would be found in the class of the virtuous guardians.
    However I think you could definitely make the argument that it would be present
    in both as well. Courage would be found in the auxiliaries or warrior class. 
    Moderation would be found everywhere, as would justice, because as discussed in 
    the earlier parts of the book, you cannot achieve injustice without first overstepping
    your boundaries.

2)  The story of Leontius is a story of how a man has a desire to stare at the corpses
    that are present in the piraeus, but reasons with himself, saying that he is 
    repulsed by his own desire. He then looks at the corpses and gets mad at himself
    for giving into his own desires. This shows that not only are desire and reason 
    part of the human soul, but also spirit/emotion. 

3)  Spirit is what gives reason purpose, without discipline, desire would overturn reason
    and become unjust, but spirit is what gives reason purpose. Its why you desire what
    you desire and for what purpose your reason has merit. Because why would Leontius 
    care about reason if he wasn't emotionally and spiritually invested? The emotions 
    that fall into spirit can be anger, as shown in the story, courage, ambition, pride,
    disgust, shame, or being competitive.

4)  Nature is referring to the natural condition of mankind. This nature 
    is chaotic, competitive, and full of conflict. In order to combat this,
    humans make an artificial "Leviathan," which is the comparable part 
    of human life, which attempts to impose order over humanity. He states that
    the Leviathan is greater and that it is the representation of reason and
    humanity.

5)  According to Hobbes, knowing thyself is more empirical than most others would 
    venture to say. He breaks it down by saying it is first an observation of human
    nature, then understanding why people want things mechanically, and that all 
    people want something; desires are universal. He also links this to the understanding
    of politics, as in order to understand and know politics, you must first know thyself.
