1)  To Hobbes, passions are very similar to what Socrates would
    call desires. Hobbes believes that passions are the driving force
    behind all human action. He believes that all human action is
    motivated by a desire to satisfy some passion. This in a sense 
    devalues what love is to nothing more than something to satisfy a
    desire. Some key desires are self-preservation, power, fear, glory,
    pride, and competition. 

2)  According to Hobbes, good is anything that you desire and bad is 
    anything that you try to avert. Each person judges good and evil
    based on their desires, leading to conflict. He argues that the 
    only objective meaning of each is given by the sovereign state. 
    The states laws turn individual desires into a unifies moral code,
    resolving such conflicts. Hobbes does not believe in universal 
    moral truths, and argues that concepts like justice or honor
    derive from human agreements, not divine or natural law.

3)  The title primarily refers to Antonio, a venetian nobleman. This
    is also debatable, however. It could also be referring to Shylock, 
    a Jewish moneylender. It could also refer to the entirety of Venice, 
    as it is a hub of trade and greed, and the plays themes often revolve
    around commerce, justice, and humanity.

4)  Antonio not being able to pay back the loan is due to a plethora of 
    reasons. His wealth is tied to his ships, which are currently lost at 
    sea. Now this is the primary reason, but Bassanio offers to pay it off 
    for him. However, Shylock refuses to accept the money, and instead 
    demands a pound of Antonio's flesh. Antonio actually accepts this,
    which frames mercy and justice in an interesting light in my opinion.

5)  In a way, Portia is the ambiguity of power in relation to everything 
    else we've read in this class. She seeks justice, but values loyalty
    over impartiality. She reflects Machiavelli by achieving her goals 
    through cunning and masking it as virtue. She uses law in the way 
    Hobbes would argue, and exposes hypocrasy in the light of Socrates.
