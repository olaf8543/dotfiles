1)  Machiavelli says that the difference in the kingdom of the turk and
    France is that the Turk was a centalized monarchy that had administrators
    with no individual authority. This differs from France in that France has 
    Feudal Decentralization, where barons hold power over land, and in turn,
    people of France aren't all completely loyal to one person. Italy most 
    resembles France, but with even more instability due to the division
    of Italy into city-states.

2)  Machiavelli says that the 3 ways to add a republic into an existing
    principality is to either Ruin Them, Reside there personally, or Allow 
    Limited Autonomy. Machiavelli says the best way to do this would be to 
    ruin them. He says it is the only secure approach and uses the romans 
    to prove this point.

3)  The 4 great founders are Moses, Cyrus the Great, Romulus, and Theseus.
    Moses clearly stands out here as the only person who achieved their
    power from a divine source. The others all relied completely on their
    virtue. Machiavelli even mentions this in a humorous way. Who is missing
    is many modern rulers, at least in Machiavelli's day. All examples he gives
    are ones from someone who is centuries before their time.

4)  Machiavelli provides many examples of what each mode is. Some of the 
    examples of "new modes" are centralized governance, as in removing the
    old feudal lords and replacing them under a unified enforcer. Another
    example is the elimination of rivals like the Orsini and Colonna families.
    Examples of the old orders are the feudalism ideology, reliance on
    situational allies like mercinaries, and a lack of centralized authority.

5)  Alexander intended to benefit his son, Cesare Borgia, using the authority 
    of the church to make a principality for him in central Italy. Unintentionally,
    he actually just helped the church, which Machiavelli claims is a mistake.
