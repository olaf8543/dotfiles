1)  When Machiavelli talks about the Imaginary Principalities, he
    is most definately referring to Plato and Socrates' City of
    justice which is ruled by the philosopher king. He says these
    are idealist and don't take into account any actual politics

2)  The effectual truth is obiously a stab at the "truth" that
    was being discussed heavily by Socrates in The Republic.
    In contrast, this "truth" has nothing to do with the good.
    This truth is more based on observable outcomes and 
    practical results than the truth Socrates was talking about.

3)  I'm a little confused by the wording of the problem. Ill assume
    you meant which one stands out in general and why. I thought it
    was interesting that he contrasted humanity and pride. As though
    he is saying that to be proud is to be inhummane. All of the other
    qualities listed are sensable opposites. Is Machiavelli saying to 
    sin is be inhumane? Is sinning important to him? Obviously not, he's
    spent all of this book telling us that he doesn't believe in that.
    This is something that does confuse me and I will ask about in class.

4)  There is literal division, eg. a state that is divided, like Italy.
    There is also a divide between virtuous and unvirtuous leaders. 
    There are favorable and unfavorable times. And in the same veign 
    as the 2nd division, there is virtue and there in fortune.

5)  While Machiavelli rejects platonic justice as impractical at points,
    he does place value in it in the essence that the ruler of a state 
    needs to appear just. He says that this appearance of virtue and 
    justice helps conceal anything that the ruler can and should do to
    properly stay in power.
